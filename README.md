## Small core task

- **Security: Begin by implementing input validation on the client side to ensure that user inputs are within expected ranges and formats. Then, validate and sanitize inputs on the server side to prevent against common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS attacks. Consider implementing measures like rate limiting and CSRF protection to enhance security further.
- **Validation: Start by validating user inputs on the client side using JavaScript to provide immediate feedback to users. Utilize HTML5 form validation attributes for basic validation and implement custom validation logic for more complex scenarios. On the server side, validate inputs again to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Tests: Begin by writing unit tests for critical functions and components of the quiz application using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha. Test user interactions, data fetching, and business logic to ensure correctness and reliability. Gradually expand test coverage to include integration tests for API endpoints and end-to-end tests for user workflows.
- **Progressive Enhancement: Design the quiz application with a focus on accessibility and usability from the outset. Use semantic HTML markup and progressive enhancement techniques to ensure core functionality is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities or using assistive technologies. Enhance the user experience with JavaScript for advanced features while ensuring that essential functionality works without it.
- **Caching: Implement browser caching for static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images to improve load times and reduce server load. Consider implementing server-side caching for frequently accessed data or computed results to improve performance further. Use caching strategies like cache control headers and cache invalidation policies to manage caching effectively.
 **-Responsive Design: Design the quiz application with responsiveness in mind, ensuring that it looks and functions well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. Use CSS media queries to apply responsive styles based on viewport width and orientation, optimizing layout and usability for different devices. Test your application on various devices and screen sizes to identify and address any issues.
- **Accessibility: Ensure that the quiz application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Use semantic HTML markup, provide descriptive alt text for images, and ensure keyboard navigation for interactive elements. Test the application with accessibility tools and screen readers to identify and address accessibility barriers, and incorporate feedback from users with disabilities to improve accessibility further.
